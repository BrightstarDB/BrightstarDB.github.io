I am pleased to announce release 1.6.1 of BrightstarDB is now available from all the usual places:

 * [MSI installer on CodePlex](https://brightstardb.codeplex.com/releases/view/121136 "BrightstarDB Installer Download")
 * [NuGet packages](https://www.nuget.org/ "NuGet.org")
 * [Documentation on ReadTheDocs.org](http://brightstardb.readthedocs.org/en/1.6.1/ "BrightstarDB Documentation")

This is primarily a bug-fix release, fixing up issues that were reported with using BrightstarDB's Entity Framework with other SPARQL stores; and issues with the sample code in the MSI package.
