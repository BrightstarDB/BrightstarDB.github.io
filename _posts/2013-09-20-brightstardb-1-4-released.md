title: BrightstarDB 1.4 Released
tags: release

We are pleased to announce that release 1.4 of BrightstarDB is now available both on [Codeplex](https://brightstardb.codeplex.com/) and on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/) (search for BrightstarDB).

The 1.4 release adds a number of new features including the ability to create snapshots of stores; the ability to retrieve statistics about a store (both described in [this earlier post](/2013/09/09/update.html)); and the ability to use the Dynamic Objects API and Entity Framework API against named graphs in the BrightstarDB store.

In addition there are some major performance improvements in import both in terms of speed but also in terms of memory consumed; and a number of bug fixes.

The store file format is unchanged from 1.3, so this is a simple and recommended upgrade for all BrightstarDB users.
