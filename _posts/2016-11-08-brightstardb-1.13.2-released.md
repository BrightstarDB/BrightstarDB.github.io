A hotfix for BrightstarDB 1.13.2 has just been released. This release fixes one more residual  issue that was found with the
implementation of the INotifyPropertyChanged interface on BrightstarDB entity collections. This is a recommended
update for all BrightstarDB users.

The new release is now available from all the usual places:

 * [MSI installer on CodePlex](https://brightstardb.codeplex.com/releases/view/629586 "BrightstarDB Installer Download")
 * [NuGet packages](https://www.nuget.org/ "NuGet.org")
 * [Documentation on ReadTheDocs.org](http://brightstardb.readthedocs.org/en/1.13/ "BrightstarDB Documentation")

Thanks to GitHub user osc117 for the bug report and useful reproduction project.
