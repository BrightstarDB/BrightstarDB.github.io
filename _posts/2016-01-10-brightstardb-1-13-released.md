I am pleased to announce release 1.13 of BrightstarDB is now available from all the usual places:

 * [MSI installer on CodePlex](http://brightstardb.codeplex.com/releases/view/619315 "BrightstarDB Installer Download")
 * [NuGet packages](https://www.nuget.org/ "NuGet.org")
 * [Documentation on ReadTheDocs.org](http://brightstardb.readthedocs.org/en/1.13/ "BrightstarDB Documentation")

This release fixes a number of bugs and has some performance fixes for RDF data import. It also introduces
some new features and enhancements to the BrightstarDB Entity Framework. There is one minor extension to the REST API, 
but the store data format and all APIs remain backwards compatible with previous releases.

Thanks to everyone who posted suggestions and reported bugs. You can get involved either on our [discussion list](https://brightstardb.codeplex.com/discussions)
or by opening an issue on our [GitHub project](https://github.com/BrightstarDB/BrightstarDB).
