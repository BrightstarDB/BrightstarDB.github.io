I am pleased to announce release 1.12 of BrightstarDB is now available from all the usual places:

 * [MSI installer on CodePlex](https://brightstardb.codeplex.com/releases/view/618652 "BrightstarDB Installer Download")
 * [NuGet packages](https://www.nuget.org/ "NuGet.org")
 * [Documentation on ReadTheDocs.org](http://brightstardb.readthedocs.org/en/1.12/ "BrightstarDB Documentation")

This release fixes a couple of bugs and adds some useability enhancements to the Polaris management console. There is one minor API extension, but existing code should not be affected. The store format remains compatible with previous releases. 

Thanks to everyone who posted suggestions and reported bugs. You can get involved either on our [discussion list](https://brightstardb.codeplex.com/discussions)
or by opening an issue on our [GitHub project](https://github.com/BrightstarDB/BrightstarDB).
