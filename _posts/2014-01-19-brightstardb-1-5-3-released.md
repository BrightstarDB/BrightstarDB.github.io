This release was made to fix a packaging issue with the Polaris tool in the 1.5.2 release. There are no other changes to the code, but we have pushed an update to NuGet as well to keep NuGet package versions in sync with release versions.

The website has also been updated to fix links to the discussion forum and add links for more recent versions of BrightstarDB documentation.
