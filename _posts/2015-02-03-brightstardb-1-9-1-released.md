I am pleased to announce release 1.9.1 of BrightstarDB is now available from all the usual places:

 * [MSI installer on CodePlex](http://brightstardb.codeplex.com/releases/view/611290 "BrightstarDB Installer Download")
 * [NuGet packages](https://www.nuget.org/ "NuGet.org")
 * [Documentation on ReadTheDocs.org](http://brightstardb.readthedocs.org/en/1.9.1/ "BrightstarDB Documentation")

This is primarily a bug-fix release addressing issues that have been found and reported by the user community.
Thanks to all those who took the trouble to report and to provide patches / suggested workarounds.

This release does also bundle up the [changes to the PCL packaging]({% post_url 2015-01-27-more-pcl-support-added %}).
This means that from this version we have support for all of the platforms supported by Xamarin.Forms. w00t!

The store format remains compatible with previous releases. There are no API changes.

For full details you can read the [What's New](http://brightstardb.readthedocs.org/en/1.9.1/Whats_New) page of the documentation.
