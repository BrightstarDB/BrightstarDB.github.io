As the CodePlex site will soon be closing down, we have moved historical releases over to their corresponding tags on GitHub. This means that you can
now download the current and past releases of BrightstarDB from [GitHub](https://github.com/BrightstarDB/BrightstarDB/releases). From this point on,
all new releases will be available only via NuGet and GitHub.
