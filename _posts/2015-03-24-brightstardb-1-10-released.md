I am pleased to announce release 1.10 of BrightstarDB is now available from all the usual places:

 * [MSI installer on CodePlex](https://brightstardb.codeplex.com/releases/view/612782 "BrightstarDB Installer Download")
 * [NuGet packages](https://www.nuget.org/ "NuGet.org")
 * [Documentation on ReadTheDocs.org](http://brightstardb.readthedocs.org/en/1.10/ "BrightstarDB Documentation")

This is primarily a bug-fix release addressing issues that have been found and reported by the user community.
Thanks to all those who took the trouble to report and to provide patches / suggested workarounds.

The store format remains compatible with previous releases. There are no API changes.

For full details you can read the [What's New](http://brightstardb.readthedocs.org/en/1.10/Whats_New) page of the documentation.
